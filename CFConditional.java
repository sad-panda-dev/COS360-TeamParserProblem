/*

YOU WILL NEED TO CODE THE eval, substitute, AND deepCopy METHODS OF THIS CLASS.
These are all defined recursively on the CFExp and don't require a lot of code.


For the CofinFin expressions with the conditional operator.  The
structure is

if set1 relop set2 then set3 else set4

so it has four CFExp data members and one comparison operator, relop, which
we will code as an int, the CFToken token id for it.

The constructors here and elsewhere ensure that only valid expressions can
be created.

   env throw an exception with message
   
   "error in eval : variable " + s + " is not bound in the environment"
   
   where s is the variable name(you don't put the code for that here; 
   it would be in the eval method of the class for variables)
   
   Otherwise, return the value of the expression obtained by using the
   values given in env
   
   So that the error messages are consistent, the code should recursively
   evaluate the subexpressions in order
   
   leftTest
   rightTest
   
   then perform the comparison indicated by relop and ONLY evaluate
   whichever of the trueChoice and falseChoice subexpressions the
   boolean result selects.  So, for example
   
   if {} = {} then {1} else x endif
   
   if {} = CMP{} then x else {2} endif
   
   should neither of them throw an exception for x being not bound
   to a value, because the test leads to x not being evaluated.
