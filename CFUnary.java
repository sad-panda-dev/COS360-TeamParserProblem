/*

YOU WILL NEED TO CODE THE eval, substitute, AND deepCopy METHODS OF THIS CLASS.
These are all defined recursively on the CFExp and don't require a lot of code.


For the CofinFin expressions with unary operators.  There is just the one,
absolute complement, so we won't include a data member for the operator at
this time.

The constructor tests the input so that only valid expressions can be created.
